1. Create Virtual Environment

steps
1. open conda prompt and after changing file location, type
conda create --name virenv  python=3.6

The conda create command builds the new virtual environment. The --name flag gives our new virtual environment the name "virenv" . I like to name my virtual environments the same name as the project that I will use that environment for, or after the name of the package that will be used the most. Including python=3.6 ensures that your virtual environment has an up to date version of python.

2. Activate virtual environment

activate virenv

3. pip install -python-telegram-bot


2. Polling Program
